# Payment Card Details App

This codebase was created to demonstrate a simple card details form application built in Angular 10 that interacts with an actual Angular Firebase server to send and fetch data.
It also includes routing, form validation, toast message notification (UI and implementation from scratch).

# How it works
## Making requests to the backend API

For convenience, I hvae use a Angular Firebase Database (https://card-details-12a34-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/card-details.json) to store and fetch data. 

# Getting started

Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. User npm install to manage the dependencies required for the setup (strongly recommended).

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. you will see angular app is running.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
